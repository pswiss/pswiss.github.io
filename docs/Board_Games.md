# Board Games

----

One of my main hobbies is board games. 
The thing I like best in a game is the ability to come up with intricate plans that may or may not pay off. 
Whether I win or not is almost entirely irrelevant to me; I'm much more driven by the intrinsic reward of coming up with these (oftentimes dumb) strategies, though it does feel really good when they actually work.

### Race for the Galaxy

This is a perfect game. The game is extraordinarily elegant, it has a length that fits in just about anywhere without feeling too short (about 30 minutes), and the variety of cards is such that just about every game feels unique, while still being predictable enough to form longer-term strategies. RftG is an engine-building game where you lay down a tableau that gives you special abilities that make it easier to draw cards and add to your engine. Importantly, cards also act as currency (i.e. to build a development, you must discard 4 cards from your hand), meaning that even if you draw a card and it doesnâ€™t fit in your plan it is still useful as a resource with which to pay for cards that you do care about. After around 25 plays, the game did start to feel a bit worn out, but adding an expansion brought back that air of unpredictability that really makes the game shine. The best thing, however, is that the game regularly sells for under $25, meaning that I have zero qualms with recommending this game to people.
