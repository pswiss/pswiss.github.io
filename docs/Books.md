# Books

I listen to a lot of audiobooks. They fit in very well to when I'm doing chores, cooking, or just walking to work, and I thoroughly enjoy experiencing these stories.

My rating system: 
- 5/5 Thoroughly enjoyed and anticipate that I'll read / listen to this book again
- 4/5 Thoroughly enjoyed but will likely not revisit
- 3/5 Enjoyed, though certain aspects of the book I didn't like. Will likely not revisit
- 2/5 It was ok, but I felt frustrated by the book by the time it was done. Will not revisit
- 1/5 Did not like, but finished it anyway.
- 0/5 Did not like and did not finish.
