### (2021) Paper: ReactiveBuild: Environment-Adaptive Self-Assembly of Amorphous Structures

_2021 International Symposium on Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems (DARS)_

[Link to demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLXcj7RptPw)

Abstract: ReactiveBuild is an algorithm that enables swarms of robots to build a variety of robust, environment-adaptive structures without pre-planning. Robots form structures by climbing their peers until either reaching a point closest to a goal location or until a neighboring robot recruits it for structural reinforcement. This contrasts with typical approaches to robotic self-assembly which generally seek to form some a priori shape. This paper demonstrates a simulated swarm of FireAnt3D robots using ReactiveBuild to form towers, chains, cantilevers, and bridges in three-dimensional environments.

### (2020) Paper: FireAnt3D: a 3D self-climbing robot towards non-latticed robotic self-assembly

Abstract: Robotic self-assembly allows robots to join to form useful, on-demand structures. Unfortunately, the methods employed by most self-assembling robotic swarms compromise this promise of adaptability through their use of fixed docking locations, which impair a swarm’s ability to handle imperfections in the structural lattice resulting from load deflection or imperfect robot manufacture; these concerns worsen as swarm size increases. Inspired by the amorphous structures built by cells and social insects, FireAnt3D uses a novel docking mechanism, the 3D continuous dock, to attach to like robots regardless of alignment. FireAnt3D demonstrates the use of the 3D continuous docks, as well as how a robot can use such docks to connect to like robots and locomote over arbitrary 3D arrangements of its peers. The research outlined in this paper presents a profoundly different approach to docking and locomotion during self-assembly and addresses longstanding challenges in the field of robotic self-assembly.

### (2019) Proposed Dissertation: Large-Scale Robotic Self-Assembly Using Alignment-Agnostic Docking

The creation of useful structures using robotic self-assembly is a yet-unattained goal in the field of swarm robotics. Using a novel orientation-agnostic attachment mechanism, I will design and build a swarm of robots capable of building a bridge by executing simple individual behaviors.

### (2019) Patent: Method and System for Docking Robotic Components

This patent, filed by Northwestern INVO, covers an orientation-agnostic docking mechanism as well as a robotic system capable of using such a mechanism to locomote.

### (2018) Paper: FireAnt: A Modular Robot with Full-Body Continuous Docks

Abstract: Nature offers many examples of organisms coming together to form self-assembling structures. The attachment methods these organisms employ allow them to grab onto others’ bodies, often without need for specific alignment or orientation, an ability absent from most existing robotic self-assembling structures, which require complicated sensing and specific alignment. This paper presents FireAnt, a modular 2D robot that demonstrates full-body continuous docks, an attachment mechanism able to attach anywhere onto other robots at any orientation, eliminating the need for alignment mechanisms and complex sensors. Such docks allow FireAnt to climb over copies of itself, something critical to self-assembling structures. This paper first discusses the design of FireAnt before presenting test results that show the strength and reliability of the continuous docks and demonstrate FireAnt’s ability to traverse an environment consisting of inert FireAnt robots. The work presented in this paper provides a docking mechanism that can minimize the mechanical complexity of modular robots and will allow the creation of swarms of rigid and adaptable self-assembling structures.
