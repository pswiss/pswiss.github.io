### About Me

- Robotics Researcher
- Board Game Enthusiast
- Avid Consumer of Audiobooks

### My Research

My research focuses on how to tackle the challenge of robotic self-assembly through the use of novel attachment mechanisms and robot design. 
It is my belief that successful robotic self-assembly requires a move away from the discretized structures which are near-universal in most self-assembling robotic systems. 
It is my hope that my research will enable self-assembling robots to form ad hoc complex and useful structures.
